Prompt Formula
Option 1

don't reply, and ask further questions to clarify your understanding.

RGC Prompting:

objective is to establish a standardized format that optimizes the framing for ChatGPT and thereby enhances its
performance across a broad spectrum of inputs.
Prompt Formula
• Role - ChatGPT’s persona (You are an expert marketer)
• Result - Desired output (Create 5 emails ending with a call to action)
• Goal - Purpose of the output (The goal is to drive sales to my product)
• Context - Who, what, where, why (The emails are for my online audience of entrepreneurs)
• Constraint - Limitations and guidelines (The emails should be friendly and less than 200 words)
Examples
• You are an expert [role]. Create [result]. The goal is [end goal]. The content is for [context]. Your guidelines for writing
are [constraints].
• You are an expert marketer. Create 5 emails ending with a call to action. The goal is to drive sales to my product. The
emails are for my online audience of entrepreneurs. The emails should be friendly and less than 200 words.
• You are an expert nutritionist. Create a 7 day meal plan for my 5 foot 7, 40 year old, female client who exercises 3
times a week. The goal is for her to lose 1 pound of fat a week by being in a caloric deficit and eating the right amount
of carbs, sugar, and protein. She doesn’t eat pork and wants to spend $200 per week on food. The meal plan
should give the recipes, cooking directions, preparation times, and a specific meal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

----------------------------------------------------


I Want You To Act As Prompting:
This second option presents another robust structure that can be applied universally to any input and intended
output. Its objective is to establish a standardized format that optimizes the framing for ChatGPT and thereby
enhances its performance across a broad spectrum of inputs.
Prompt Formula
1. “I want you to act as a…” (historian, biologist, etc.) This helps to set the stage for ChatGPT’s persona.
2. “I will give you…” (my target audience, a specific direction, a product, etc.) This is where you set up the dynamic
between you and ChatGPT.
3. “You will then…” (create 5 emails, make a video script, summarize, etc.)
4. “In a _____ tone/style…” (upbeat, professional, tabular format) This is where you explain your desired output along
with the personality/style of writing for the output.
5. “The important details are…” (target audience, cost per project, etc.) Be sure to explain all important details and
elaborate on specifics from bullet point 2.
6. Refine your output as needed “Be more persuasive” “Put the most important keywords in bold” “Now put this in
tabular format”
Examples
• I want you to act as a personal coach. I will give you my personal and professional goals. You will then create a 7
day schedule in tabular format for me to follow in order to hit my goals. My short term daily goals are meditate,
workout, read, and work on my projects. My long term goals are to sign 30 new clients and save $10,000 over the next
6 months.
• I want you to act as a virtual doctor. I will describe my symptoms and you will provide a diagnosis and treatment
plan. You should only reply with your explanation, diagnosis, and treatment plan, and nothing else. My important
details are, "I have been experiencing a headache and dizziness for the last few days, what could be the cause?”
